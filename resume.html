        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>My Story</h4>
        <p>I had my first working experiences in logistics and retail, but after moving to London in 2015 I moved to the hospitality industry. I spent nearly ten years there, growing both professionaly and personally while working in high-end restaurants and private member clubs. During that time I gained different skills as being able to communicate effectively with international clients and colleagues, while consistently delivering high-quality service in high-pressure environments. These taught me how to stay calm, plan in advance and keep things running smoothly, even in fast-paced demanding environments. But over the time i felt the need for a change, something that would allow me to create, learn continuously, and work remotely. That's when I decided to reinvent myself and to start my journey into tech. In 2024, I enrolled for the <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/global/" target="_blank">Code Institute</a>'s Full Stack Developer Course, and started studying web development, gradually transitioning into a more creative and fulfilling career path, and eventually leaving my job in hospitality, moved back to Italy and achieving my diploma. This journey taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of building things and pursue goals that are both functional and meaningful. Now, I help individuals and businesses bring their ideas to life through intuitive, responsive, and visually engaging websites — while continuing to develop my own projects with creativity and passion.</p>
<h4>My Tech Stack</h4>
<p>I build modern, responsive websites and web applications with a strong focus on clean code, accessibility, and user experience.</p>
<h5>Languages & Tools:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
  <li>React (with hooks)</li>
  <li>Django & Django REST Framework</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL</li>
  <li>Bootstrap / AOS / Custom CSS</li>
  <li>Git / GitHub / Heroku</li>
</ul>
<h4>What I Build</h4>
<p>I mostly work with small businesses, professionals, and digital creatives to create:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Portfolio websites for individuals looking to showcase their work</li>
  <li>Restaurant or hospitality websites with booking systems</li>
  <li>Landing pages for new products or local businesses</li>
  <li>Games and interactive experiences</li>
  <li>Custom dashboards or admin panels with Django backends</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're looking for a developer who can turn your idea into a clean, effective website — you're in the right place.</p>
