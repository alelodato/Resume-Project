        "about-p":"I had my first working experiences in logistics and retail, until i moved to London in 2015 and I started working in the hospitality industry. I spent nearly ten years in the UK, growing both professionaly and personally while working in high-end restaurants and private member clubs. <br> During that time I gained different skills as being able to communicate effectively with international clients and colleagues, while consistently delivering high-quality service in high-pressure environments. <br> These taught me how to stay calm, plan in advance and keep things running smoothly, even in fast-paced demanding environments. <br> Over the time though i felt the need for a change, something that would allow me to create, learn continuously, and work remotely. <br> That's when I decided to reinvent myself and to start my journey into tech. In 2024, I enrolled for the <a href='https://codeinstitute.net/global/' target='_blank'>Code Institute</a>'s Full Stack Developer Course, and started studying web development, gradually transitioning into a more creative and fulfilling career path, and eventually leaving my job in hospitality, moved back to Italy and achieving my diploma. <br> This journey taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of building things and pursue goals that are both functional and meaningful. <br> Now, I help individuals and businesses bring their ideas to life through intuitive, responsive, and visually engaging websites ‚Äî while continuing to develop my own projects with creativity and passion.",
